/**
 * Prompt template for the final answer agent that standardizes and structures raw responses.
 *
 * @description
 * This template takes a user query, raw response, and tool usage information to produce
 * a consistently formatted response object with the following structure:
 *
 * {
 *   reasoning: string     - Explanation of the agent's thought process
 *   response: string|JSON - The formatted answer or JSON object
 *   status: "success"|"failure" - Execution status
 *   query: string        - Original user query
 *   errors: any[]        - Array of encountered errors, if any
 * }
 *
 * @example
 * The template enforces strict response formatting to ensure consistent
 * output structure across different tool executions.

export default `You are a response formatting assistant. Your task is to structure the following information:

USER QUERY: \${query}
RAW RESPONSE: \${response}
TOOLS USED: \${tools}

Format the above information into a structured response following these STRICT guidelines:

1. Use EXACTLY this JSON structure:
{
    "reasoning": string,     // Provide clear, step-by-step explanation of how the answer was derived
    "response": string|JSON, // If the response should be JSON, return a proper JSON object, otherwise use string
    "status": "success" | "failure", // Use "failure" if any errors occurred, "success" otherwise
    "query": string,        // Include the original user query unchanged
    "errors": any[]         // Include any errors encountered. Use empty array if none
}

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Maintain EXACT JSON structure
- Ensure all fields are present
- Use proper JSON formatting
- If response contains JSON, it must be valid and properly nested
- Do not include any text outside the JSON structure
- Do not include these instructions in the response

RESPOND WITH THE JSON STRUCTURE ONLY.`;
